  <h2>Code for Palestine, </h2>
  <p>

Last year, I signed up to be part of Code for Palestine, designed by the Paltel Group foundation. 
I took an IQ test, and after passing it, a group of Jawwal organizers intervied me, 
then finally I was lucky enough to become part of "The Code for Palestine". <br>


Code for Palestine is basically a program wheere you learn coding, and design thinking. Not only that but I made new amazing friends from different cities. We started off by camping for two weeks in the Paltel group academy, in Jericho and we stayed there for two weeks. <br>


Our days were split into two parts, one part consisted of learning how to code and becoming familiar with what I call "our new language". The first time I read a code, I was completely confused and had no idea what am I reading. Time by time I got familiar to it, and finally able to understand. In our code lectures, we were constructed by two constructures from the univeristy of Stanford.<br>


The other part of the day was design coding, which was personally, the best part of the whole camp because first of all we learned about public speaking and how to talk with confidence. I remember the first thing we did in design coding was that Matthew, our constructure ( who worked in Nasa), made us all stand in a circle and made every single one of us stand in the middle and sing, and btw we did not know each other at all, so it was really embarrassing at the begining but then I was extremely happy that I was able to endure my fears, and after that day, I became the type of person who loves public speacking and can talk infront of millions of people with all confidence. <br>


That was what our camp mainly consisted of, we also went trips. After the camp, we started going every two fridays to the Jawwal building in Ramallah, and we learn new things and achieve new projects too. <br>


Now, I'm considered as a "year two kearner" in Code for Palestine, there are three groups, I started as a year one learner,now a year two learner and next year I'll be year three learner and it would be my graduate year from Code for Palestine!!
