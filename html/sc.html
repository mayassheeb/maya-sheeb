  <h2>Pioneers Baccalaureate School,</h2>
  <p>OR you can just call my school PBS, It's in Nablus. I've been studing in PBS since first grade, my school is different from all the other schools in Nablus because it does not follow the administration's system, which is called "Tawjihi". Instead, we study a system that comes from America, which is the S.A.T. We have to take six SATs to graduate, but anyways, I ain't gonna talk more about how the SAT system works here, I mean it's a pretty stressful topic, lol. <br>  

I made a lifetime true friendships in my school that take a huge part in my life, I will talk about them later, but I guess that's it for now. <br>

Oh, and also, talking about school, next year (2018-2019), I won't be studying in PBS, instead I will be studing in the US, with "Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study". <br>

I'm part of many clubs in my school, for example, Basketball, and we got the first place in the administration's basketball competetion between most schools in Nablus. ALso, Palteach, MUN, Palroots.</p>
