  <h2>Scouts</h2>
  <p>The first thing that really changed me was my scouts. I became part of scouts when I was nine years old. In my scouts, we usually camp, learn about different thiings that we don't usually learn in school , for example, we learned about ties, and the different types of them. <br>

We also do some community service activities, for example, our last community service activity was when we went to a new school and painted the outer walls with inspirational drawings for the students. <br>

Scouts really changed a huge part of me, at the begining, when I was young I never realized that scout would ever change, but as I grew up and became more committed to it, I began to see the change in me. So every time I swear the "promise", I become more committed, not only in my actions, but also in my own heart.

My role model in scouts is our constructer May IE, she supported me all the way and always made me excited to cooperate in more social activities and be the change I want to see in my community.
